# Intro

Swift UI is pretty different from UIKit or other UI frameworks. Views are values, not objects and are expressed declaratively. It also has it's own layout system (Oh great, another iOS layout system).

# Overview
To construct views in SwiftUI, you create a tree of view values that describe what should be onscreen. To change whatâ€™s onscreen, you modify state, and a new tree of view values is computed. SwiftUI then updates the screen to reflect these new view values.
